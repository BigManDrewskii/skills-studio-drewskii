# Six Minds Framework

A cognitive science framework for understanding how users actually think and experience your product. Based on "Design for How People Think" by John Whalen.

## What This Skill Does

Guides you through the Six Minds framework to identify gaps in your design where users' cognitive systems aren't being supported. Most products only address 2 of the 6 minds—this helps you engage all of them.

## How to Use

1. Invoke the skill: `/six-minds-framework`
2. Describe your feature, product, or design problem
3. Answer questions about your users' experience
4. Get a Six Minds analysis with specific recommendations

## The Six Minds

Your users' brains are not one system—they're 6 parallel systems running all the time:

1. **Vision/Attention** (Wayfinding)
   - What are they looking at?
   - What catches their attention?
   - Can they answer: "Where am I? What can I do here?" in 3 seconds?

2. **Language/Conversation**
   - How do they talk about this to themselves?
   - What words do they use?
   - Does your interface speak their language?

3. **Emotion**
   - How do they feel at each step?
   - What do they want to feel?
   - Are you addressing anxiety, trust, excitement, frustration?

4. **Social Cognition**
   - Who else is involved?
   - How do they want to be seen?
   - Who's watching? Who do they answer to?

5. **Spatial Cognition/Navigation**
   - Where does this fit in their workflow?
   - Where does this live in your product?
   - Does the flow match their mental model?

6. **Memory/Learning**
   - What must they remember?
   - What can they forget?
   - What can be offloaded to the system?

## Key Principle

**The 6 minds work in parallel. ALL THE TIME.**

Your design must work for all 6 simultaneously. Or it doesn't work.

Most UX focuses only on Vision + Language. But watch someone actually use your product:
- They open it (Vision)
- Scan for info (Language)
- Feel overwhelmed (Emotion) ← Unaddressed
- Worry about looking incompetent (Social) ← Unaddressed
- Can't find where they started (Spatial) ← Unaddressed
- Quit because it's too much cognitive load (Memory) ← Unaddressed

5 out of 6 minds are saying "no."

## Questions This Skill Will Ask

When you invoke this skill, be ready to describe:

1. **Your Product/Feature**: What are you designing?
2. **Your Users**: Who are they? What's their context?
3. **The Problem**: What issue are you trying to solve? What behavior are you trying to encourage or discourage?
4. **Current State**: What does the current experience look like?

Based on your answers, this skill will generate:
- A Six Minds audit of your current design
- Specific recommendations for each mind
- Interview questions to gather more data
- Example improvements from similar products

## When to Use This Skill

- Before designing a new feature
- When users aren't engaging with your product
- When beautiful design has low conversion
- When you're stuck on why users "don't get it"
- Before user interviews (to know what to watch for)
- When simplifying made things worse (minimalism that removed support systems)
